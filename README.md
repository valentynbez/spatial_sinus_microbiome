# Determinants of the microbiome spatial variability in chronic rhinosinusitis
A repository that contains analysis code for the paper ["Determinants of the microbiome spatial variability in chronic rhinosinusitis"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.02.509831v2) by Szaleniec et al. 2022.  
The analysis is split in two folders, `microbiome-analysis` and `picrust2-analysis`.   
In the first folder, the microbiome analysis using [QIIME2](https://qiime2.org/) is stored. In folder `microbiome-analysis/artifacts` you may find a custom feature classifier produced with the use of [RESCRIPt](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8601625/). 
In the second folder, we performed functional prediction using [PICRUSt2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0548-6) & analyzed the predictions obtained from the pipeline.
